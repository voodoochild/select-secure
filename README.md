# Select Secure

A *very rough* sketch of an idea developed at the [DC Internet Freedom Hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dc-internet-freedom-hackathon-tickets-9306081741) on 11th Jan 2014 to explore ways of helping different people to select the communication security tools that could meet their needs.

Right now, there's a rough mock-up here presented at the end of the day.

## Working notes

[This etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/S3oiZ5xtjW) provided a workspace for mocking up the data structure that might drive a future version of this tool (also found in [data.json](https://github.com/voodoochild/select-secure/blob/master/data/data.json))


## Learning reflections

- The interface needs to not just talk about trust, but also the security gained through each choice
- Finding a data model that can capture the complexity of how security tools interact is difficult - and needs more work (Are there ontologies for describing security tools?)

## Development plans

None at present. Interested in taking the idea forward? Please go ahead. Drop us a line perhaps - but no requirement to do so.
