# Select Secure

A *very rough* sketch of an idea developed at the [DC Internet Freedom Hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dc-internet-freedom-hackathon-tickets-9306081741) on 11th Jan 2014 to explore ways of helping different people to select the communication security tools that could meet their needs.

Right now, there's a rough mock-up here presented at the end of the day.

## The idea

- There are many different layers involved in being secure online;
- Identifying the rights tools for the job is tricky right now; 
- Tools often tell users what they cannot do, but do not point users to resources that show how to combine tools to address the particular threat models a user is facing;
- Structured meta-data about different security tools **and practices** could be used to build out tools that help users in making sensible choices;
- Common visual languages could also help users understand what tools are doing, and could provide a pathway into deeper technical understanding of security tools;

## Working notes

[This etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/S3oiZ5xtjW) provided a workspace for mocking up the data structure that might drive a future version of this tool (also found in [data.json](https://github.com/voodoochild/select-secure/blob/master/data/data.json))


## Learning reflections

- The interface needs to not just talk about trust, but also the security gained through each choice
- Finding a data model that can capture the complexity of how security tools interact is difficult - and needs more work (Are there ontologies for describing security tools?)

## Development plans

None at present. Interested in taking the idea forward? Please go ahead. Drop us a line perhaps - but no requirement to do so.
