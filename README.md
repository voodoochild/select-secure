# Select Secure

A *very rough* sketch of an idea developed at the [DC Internet Freedom Hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dc-internet-freedom-hackathon-tickets-9306081741) on 11th Jan 2014 to explore ways of helping different people to select the communication security tools that could meet their needs.

Right now, there's a rough mock-up here presented at the end of the day.
